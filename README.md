# Redmine Tweaks by UDOX

Plugin / style / script tweaks for redmine by @udox to fit our workflow

This probably will not work for you just yet. It's very much an inplace 
patch & amend as we go thing. The plan is however to package it into some
sort of single plugin with configuration and more general scripts so it
fits a default or customized redmine install.

For now this is used within [udox](http://github.com/udox).
